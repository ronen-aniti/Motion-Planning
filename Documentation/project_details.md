What was the central focus of my learning with this project at a high conceptual level? What was the central focus of my learning at a more detailed level?

Summarize those more detailed concepts. 

Programming concepts and tools. 
Numpy for vectorized operations. Matplotlib for visualization. Event driven programming. Object oriented programming. Practice implementing algorithms for navigation.  

Receding Horizon Planning Scheme.
What is it, and what is it made of? 

Global Planners
What is a global planner, and why is it important? What global planners have I learned about and implemented in my code?
2d grid. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in my code. Picture of global plan that it produces. 
Voronoi graph. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in my code. Picture of global plan that it produces. 
Prm. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in my code. Picture of global plan that it produces. 
Rrt. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in my code. Picture of global plan that it produces. 
Potfield. How it works generally. How I implemented it in my code. Picture of global plan that it produces. 

Local Planners
What is a local planner, and why is it important? What local planner do I have implemented in my code? 
Potential field. How does the local implementation work in my code? Picture of a few local plans that it produces. 

Replanning.
What is replanning? How did I implement replanning in my code? 

Challenges faced during the process of building this project. 
Challenge 1. How I solved it. 
Challenge 2. How I solved it.
Challenge 3. How I solved it. 

Future Directions. 
What would I do if I had more time to optimize this project? Learn more about Numpy. Learn more about matplotlib. Dive deeper into vector calculus. Practice data structures and algorithms. Continue to practice logic problems on khan academy. Take on a new project about control
theory to perhaps put all these skills into practice. 

Why this project matters to me. 
I am seeking employment. I identify as a scientist or engineer. I want to begin a career. This is me building my case.
