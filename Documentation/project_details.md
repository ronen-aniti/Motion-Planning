# Project Details

## What features did I implement?
Answer. 
1. Global path planning. Summary of what that means. 
2. Receding horizon path planning. Summary of what that means. 
3. Replanning. Summary of that means. 

## How do those features work?
Answer.

### The global path planners
The global planners are these, and they work like this.
1. RRT. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
2. PRM. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
3. Potential field. How it works, generally, including the governing equation. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory.

4. 2d Grid. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
5. Voxel map. How it works generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
6. Voronoi graph. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
7. Medial axis map. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory.
8. 2d graph. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph or trajectory. 

### The local path planner
The receding horizon planner definition. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 

### Replanning
The definition of replanning. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory.

## What challenges did I face, and how did I solve them? 
1. Challenge 1. Solution 1. 
2. Challenge 2. Solution 2.
3. Challenge 3. Solution 3. 

## Some Test Results
Plot 2 bar graphs. The first one will show the average runtime, n=1000, for each global planner. The second will show the average cost, n=1000, for each planner. Make a brief statement about how I used
this information to set the default planner. But also make a statement about the relative pros and cons about each planner.

## Where would I go with this project if I had more time? 
1. Learn more Numpy, Matplotlib
2. Learn more about data structures and algorithms
3. Dive deeper into multivariable calculus. 
4. Begin learning about control systems. 

## How could I test out this code on my own computer? 
1. Install. Simulator. FCND environment with packages like this, this, and this.  
2. Run. On terminal, python main.py.
3. Modify parameters. Test out different geodetic destinations. Or add different geodetic destinations to a list of destinations.
