## Introduction
Introduction to myself. Introduction to this project. Optional. A Video Presentation with Live Simulator Footage, under 5 Minutes. 

## Project Details
### What is this project really about? 
### Why does this project matter to me? 
### What concepts did I learn about? 
### What features did I implement? 
1. Global path planning. Summary of what that means. 
2. Receding horizon path planning. Summary of what that means. 
3. Replanning. Summary of that means. 

### How do those features work?
The planning features are these. 
1. RRT. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
2. PRM. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
3. Potential field. How it works, generally, including the governing equation. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
$$\vec{F}= -\nabla{U}(x,y,z) \\\\
d_o=f_1(x,y,z), d_g=f_2(x,y,z)\\\\
U_{r}=\frac{k_o}{d{_o}^{2}}, U_{a}=\frac{k_g}{d{_g}^{2}}\\\\
\vec{F} = -\nabla{(\frac{k_o}{d{_o}^{2}} + \frac{k_g}{d{_g}^{2}})}$$
4. 2d Grid. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
5. Voxel map. How it works generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
6. Voronoi graph. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
7. Medial axis map. How it works, generally. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
Receding horizon planing and replanning are added features. 
The receding horizon planning feature functions to what it is. How I implemented it in code. Graph of trajectory. 
The replanning feature in general means this. I incorperate it into my code by introducing a battery model that depletes. The drone computes the cost of trajectories and lands when necessary to recharge.

2. Challenge 2. Solution 2.
3. Challenge 3. Solution 3. 

### Where would I go with this project if I had more time? 
1. Learn more Numpy
2. Explore Matplotlib
3. Dive deeper into multivariable calculus. 
4. Begin learning about control systems. 

### How could I test out this code on my own computer? 
1. Install.
2. Run. 
3. Modify parameters. 

## Contact me
### How could you learn more about me? 
1. Email or text me.

Future Directions. 
What would I do if I had more time to optimize this project? Learn more about Numpy. Learn more about matplotlib. Dive deeper into vector calculus. Practice data structures and algorithms. Continue to practice logic problems on khan academy. Take on a new project about control
theory to perhaps put all these skills into practice.
